# Linear Regression — Programming Exercise 1

Hey! This repo contains **my own project work** inspired by Andrew Ng’s *Machine Learning* course on Coursera.  
I’m sharing **my code and experiments only** 

---

## What this is:

I implemented linear regression two ways:

- **Univariate** (one feature) with **gradient descent**  
- **Multivariate** (multiple features) using the **normal equation**

Along the way, the notebook:
- Plots the raw data (scatter)
- Implements the cost function **J(θ)** and tracks it during training
- Visualizes the **3D cost surface** and **contours** for θ₀/θ₁

If you just want to *see something work*, open the notebook and hit “Run All”. If you want to *understand* what’s happening, read the short notes in each section.

# Logistic Regression — Programming Exercise 2 

Hey! This repo collects **my project work** for logistic regression, inspired by Andrew Ng’s Coursera course.  
I’m sharing **my code and experiments only**.

---

## What this is:

I built a logistic regression classifier to predict a binary outcome, then extended it with L2 regularization, decision boundary visualization, and numerical optimization.
- Uses a sigmoid activation and a cross-entropy cost function
- Computes analytical gradients and verifies learning behavior
- Adds L2 regularization to reduce overfitting
- Plots the decision boundary so you can see what the model learned

If you just want to *see it work*, open the notebook and hit **Run All**. If you want to *understand* it, read the short notes sprinkled through the sections.
